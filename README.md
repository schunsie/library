# Library
### Your story, one book at a time. [Live Preview](https://schunsie.github.io/library)
Library is a lightweight Library WebApp written in Javascript. The WebApp allows the user to keep track of the books they've read (or not read), in addition to some basic info (title, author, pages)

Library has been designed as a project for The Odin Project.

Within the WebApp users can:
- Add books
- Remove books
- Mark books as read unread

Storage between page reloads has not been covered yet within the course and is therefore not functional. This will be added in a later stage.
